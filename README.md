# Correlation Between Responsiveness of Metro Nashville Public Services and Population Groups

hubNashville is the arm of the Metro Nashville Government dedicated to servicing non-emergency situations such as dead animal pickup, fence repair, trash pickup, etc. Both residents and vistors to the area can avail themselves of the service. Requests are made to hubNashville, either online or by phone. Data is stored as variables including: Case request, case subrequest, time request was opened, time request was closed (if it was closed), etc.

My goal was to determine if there are any correlations or patterns that can be discerned based on demographic information and the effectiveness of hubNashville. By mapping demographic information by census tract about the Metro Nashville area from the American Community Survey (ACS) and overlaying the hubNashille data on top, analysis can be performed to discern any correlations or patterns. How quickly are cases resolved? Does duration of request correlate to demographic information? Are there any patterns in the types of requests made with regards to demographics? Does the volume of cases correlate to demographic information?

Demographic information will be presented at the census tract level, and will include: percentage by race (white, asian, hispanic, black), population, median income, and median age.

There are some assumption I must make. First, I assume "closed" means that the case was resolved to the satisfaction of the person(s) making the request. Second, the person(s) making the request are representative of the tract where the request was made. This last assumption is a problem because visitors to any given census tract can use hubNashville, making some data potentially irrelevant to the analysis.

Finally, because the pandemic hampered collection of federal census data in 2020 and 2021, I used to both ACS and hubNashville data from 2019.
